Let us introduce project "Alice" from T4Framework. Project "Alice" was created by thinking about how to easily explain the T4Framework to creators. Project "Alice" is a Defense game made by T4Framework, which shows T4Framework's functions naturally while enjoying the game.

<center><h5>Project Alice : Playable Demo</h5></center>

Project Alice was developed by just three Technical Designers at VirtualFlow inc., 
and it took them only about two months to finish up designing and developing the whole game. 
The low-poly, casual-looking assets were deliberately chosen for a better performance in mobile devices, 
and not a single line of code or a blob of BP node was needed to develop the game; 
everything was done with just the basic features of Unreal Engine and the tools provided by T4Framework.

<center><h2>- Project Alice, Review -</h2></center>
Alice, the protagonist of the game, fell asleep while making a game with T4Framework. 
Shortly after, she gets summoned to that very game she was developing. 
In order to get herself back to the real world, she has to clear the quests she created and eventually beat the final boss. In the process, 
Alice will talk about how she made each section of the game, which will let you glance over how T4Framework was used to set up various NPCs, the main character’s Skills, and the in-game quests, etc.

<center><h5>Project Alice : Introducing</h5></center>
James Cho, a beta tester for T4Framework, goes over the contents of Project Alice and explains why it would benefit someone to use T4Framework along with Unreal Engine. 
You’ll get to take a look at the tools provided by and core functionalities of T4Framework in this video.

<center><h5>Project Alice : Quest Flow</h5></center>
The beta tester James introduces the QuestFlow feature of T4Framework, which played a significant role in developing Project Alice. 
T4's QuestFlow makes lets even less experienced developers create a complex quest system that would have required expert developers otherwise. 
With QuestFlow, one can create various types of in-game quests with the intuitive node-based UI (a patented product of VirtualFlow inc.), 
which guarantees to provide the user with an excellent UX.

<center><h2>- A Word from Our Beta Tester -</h2></center>
> I have been a self-taught hobbyist game developer for a while, and what I learned from my journey was that making video games isn’t a simple task. For instance, writing a logic for the quest system for the RPG I was working on was a lot of hassle mentally and timewise also as my project got bigger in size. I ended up having to write codes for every aspect of my game and felt exhausted: Having the player receive a quest from an NPC, displaying the dialogue between them, setting conditions for completing the quest, etc. <br><br>
> Then, I came across T4Framework and realized that it might be a solution to all the nit-picky problems that had plagued me for months. I was especially impressed with T4’s QuesetFlow feature as I could entirely skip coding and just use its node-based graph tool to create quests for my game. To this end, as soon as I heard that VirtualFlow inc. was looking for a beta tester for T4Framework, I signed up for it.<br><br>
> I got the impression that, with T4Framework, anyone with quality assets can develop a video game regardless of his or her level of skill as a developer. I hope more and more developers like myself, who occasionally have a hard time coming up with a logic for certain parts of the game’s system, can utilize T4Framework to boost their development process and focus more on creating contents. - James Cho
